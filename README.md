# rasterizationModeling
Rasterization project for CSC561 Computer Graphics. 
Developed basic modeling, transforms, lighting on 3D objects using the WebGL rasterization API.

## tasks completed:
* Part 0: properly turned in assignment 
* Part 1: render the input triangles, without lighting
* Part 2: model and render the input ellipsoids, without lighting
* Part 3: light the ellipsoids and triangles
* Part 4: interactively change view
* Part 5: interactively select a model
* Part 6: interactively change lighting
* Part 7: interactively transform the ellipsoids and triangles
